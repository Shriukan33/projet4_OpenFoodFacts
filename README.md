## Installation

### 1. Change current directory to be where you want the project to be
    cd <future project folder> 
 
### 2. Clone the github project
    git clone https://github.com/Shriukan33/projet_5_OpenFoodFacts.git

### 3. Get into the project's folder
    cd projet_5_OpenFoodFacts

### 4. Create a virtual environnement (recommended)
    python -m venv venv

### 5. Activate your virtual environnement (if you went through step 4)
#### Windows
    venv/Scripts/activate
#### Linux / MacOS
    . venv/bin/activate

### 6. Install project's depedencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### 7. Complete the config file "settings_local.py"
In order to connect and create a database in MySQL, the script requires that you enter 
your password for the `root` user inside the `ROOT_PASSWORD` constant at line 2 of `src/settings_local.py`

You can also modify the name of the created database with `DB_NAME` if you like, by default this is `off_database`.

## Running the app

You're now ready to run the app ! 

Two options, you can : 
* Create the database without launching the main script by simply launching `python src/db_setup.py`
* Or launch directly the `src/main.py` to create the database if needed and then start looking for alternatives. 


### Main menu

You're presented 3 options : 
* 1. Replace a product
* 2. See your saved results 
* 3. Exit the app

#### Replace a product

Replacing a product is a multistep process: 
* You first need to pick the category of your product, among the 5 most popular ones in France. This will display the list of available products you can replace.

    ID - Name of the product - Nutriscore grade

* Then you enter the ID of the product you want to replace, this is the leftmost number. 
* You're presented up to 3 alternatives to this product, it's possible that your product has less than 3 better alternatives (Nutriscore wise), or has none.
* You can choose to save this result for later and easier consultation.

#### See saved results
If you saved results before, you can now see a simplified version of the product you saved results for. 

You can then choose to display results, or simple go back to main menu. 

If you want to display a saved results, entering the ID will display the alternatives the same way it did in the replace product section. 

#### Exit the app

Terminates your instance. But don't worry, the database doesn't need to be created again, and saved results will stay.
