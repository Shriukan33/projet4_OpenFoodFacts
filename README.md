You can also modify the name of the created database with `DB_NAME` if you like, by default this is `off_database`.

## Running the app

You're now ready to run the app ! 

Two options, you can : 
* Create the database without launching the main script by simply launching `python src/db_setup.py`

* Or launch directly the `src/main.py` to create the database if needed and then start looking for alternatives.

### Main menu

You're presented 3 options : 
* 1. Replace a product
* 2. See your saved results 
* 3. Exit the app

#### Replace a product

Replacing a product is a multistep process: 
* You first need to pick the category of your product, among the 5 most popular ones in France. This will display the list of available products you can replace.

* Then you enter the ID of the product you want to replace, this is the leftmost number.

* You're presented up to 3 alternatives to this product, it's possible that your product has less than 3 better alternatives (Nutriscore wise), or has none.

#### See saved results
If you saved results before, you can now see a simplified version of the product you saved results for. 

You can then choose to display results, or simple go back to main menu.
